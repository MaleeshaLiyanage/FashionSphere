# FashionSphere — Business Analyst Role

   FashionSphere is my academic project where I worked for some parts in my project as a **Business Analyst** to design and document a modern clothing web application focused on the **Sri Lankan fashion industry**. By exploring and observing several existing online clothing platforms in Sri Lanka, I identified various difficulties and weaknesses in their systems. Based on these findings, I covered a wide range of business analysis activities including gathering user requirements, analyzing problems and proposing practical feature improvements. This project helped me understand how a Business Analyst bridges business needs with technical solutions and contributes to building user-friendly, efficient systems tailored to local industry demands.

# Objective
To analyze and propose new features for an online fashion web app that helps customers shop easily and assists admins in managing products effectively.

    - Gathered requirements and listed new features like stock alerts, order history, and sale notifications.
    - Created basic process flow diagrams to explain how users and admins interact with the system.
    - Wrote simple feature descriptions and documentation.
    - Decided some improvements to make the system more user-friendly.
